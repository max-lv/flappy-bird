## What

This yet another *Flappy Bird* port for *GameBoy*.

This time written in Forth!
(using GBForth: https://gbforth.org/)

Be warned this is my first game for *GameBoy* and my first ever program in Forth :)


I made sure to make graphics as faithful as possible, thru it still misses bird's inclanation and borders on pipes.
Gameplay vise there is no medals.
